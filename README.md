## React Redux Example App

### [Live Demo](http://learning-cards.surge.sh/)

This a simple english/turkish word memorizing app built with React and Redux. Words in sample lists are part of [Oxford 3000](http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/oxford3000) list. Word definitions are gathered thanks to [Yandex Dictionary API](https://tech.yandex.com/dictionary/) and served from a mock API with a simulated delay.

You can check out a [live demo](http://learning-cards.surge.sh/) or run it locally:

```
npm install

npm start
```

### TODO:

- [x] Deploy a demo 
- [ ] Create a [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) version
- [ ] [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) instead of mock api
- [ ] User Acconts and custom wordlists
